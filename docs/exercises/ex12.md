# Exercise 12

Implement a class `HuffmanIso` that extends `Huffman`.
In such class, override the methods `writeTrie` and `readTrie`.
When writing/reading a char for a given leaf node, use the charset ISO-8859-1 instead
of the current UTF-16 in `Huffman`.

Note 0: you would lose Unicode support by doing it.

Note 1: for coding/decoding, you can use the method `getBytes` in `String` with
charset `Charset.forName("ISO-8859-1")`.

Write a test class `HuffmanIsoTest` with the following two tests:

* `testCompareOnShortNorwegianSentence` in which you compare both `HuffmanIso` and
  `Huffman` on the text string "Jeg ønsker å få en god karakter i denne eksamenen"
  encoded in UTF-8.
  Verify that `HuffmanIso` can compress it, whereas `Huffman` actually makes it bigger.
  Explain why. 

* `testCompareOnBook` in which you compare both `HuffmanIso` and
  `Huffman` on the text of the Odyssey book encoded in UTF-8.
  Verify that both `HuffmanIso` and `Huffman` do compress it, but their difference
  in compression ratio is minimal (i.e., less than 0.001). 
  Explain why.
