# Exercise 07

Consider the following interface:

    public interface AnotherStream<T> {
    
        Iterator<T> iterator();
    
        /**
         * Terminal operation. Count number
         * of elements in the stream.
         */
        int count();
    
        /**
         * Filtering operation that only let pass an element
         * once. Ie, if an element in the stream is
         * present more than once, it will be propagated to
         * the stream only once, the first time it is seen.
         */
        AnotherStream<T> distinct();
    
        /**
         * Filtering operation that does ignore and skip
         * the first n elements coming from the stream.
         */
        AnotherStream<T> skip(int n);
    }

Implement a class called `AnotherStreamList` that extends `IterableLinkedList` and
that has the following method:

    public AnotherStream<T> stream()
    
When implementing `AnotherStreamList`, you can reuse code parts from `MyStreamSupport`.
In particular, the `count()` terminal operation has some similarities with `collectToList()`,
in which you will need to implement your own `Consumer` to count the number of elements
that go through the stream.     

Write test cases to verify that your implementation of `AnotherStream` is correct.
