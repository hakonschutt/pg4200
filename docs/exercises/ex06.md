# Exercise 06

Write a class called `DrawRedBlackTreeMap` that extends `RedBlackTreeMap`.
You need to provide a new method `public void draw()` that can draw the tree on the 
standard output.
For each node, you should print the key, not the value.
Red nodes should be within `()`, whereas black nodes in `[]`.
Following is an example of a printed tree with 5 nodes:

             [5]
            /   \
           /     \
        (3)       [6]
       /   \         
    [2]    [4]   
  

When you are implementing the `draw()` function, you can make the following assumptions:
* keys are printed with just 1 char (eg, digits from 0 to 9)
* the depth of the tree will be at most 3 (as in the above example)

In other words, you do not need to write a function that can draw any kind of tree, but
just the ones within those constrains (which will make the implementation of `draw()` much
easier).

Write a `main` method in which you instantiate such tree, and add one element at a time,
 in an order in which these shapes are obtained:
 
    1) [?]
    
    
    2)    [?]
         /    
       (?)
       
    
    3)   [?]
        /   \
      [?]   [?]   
   
    
    4)      [?]
           /   \
          /     \
       [?]       [?]
                /   
              (?)   

    5)         [?]
              /   \
             /     \
          (?)       [?]
         /   \         
      [?]    [?]       
  

Note: in the above printed output I replace the keys with a `?` placeholder.
It is your job to find the right 5 values for which, once inserted, you go
through those tree shapes, until the final one.
