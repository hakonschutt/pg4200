# Exercise 09

Consider the class `HillClimbingForQueens`. 
Modify the Hill Climbing algorithm to use "Steepest Ascent":
instead of climbing to the first better element in the neighbourhood,
first look at all the candidate solutions in the neighbourhood, and
then move toward the best.
Implement such new variant in a class called `SteepestAscentHCforQueens`.

Write a test class `SteepestAscentHCforQueensTest` in which you test your
steepest ascent version on boards of size 8, 16, 20 and 100.
