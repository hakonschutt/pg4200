# Exercise 05

Write a class called `TernaryTreeMap` that extends `MyTreeBasedMap`.
This class should be similar to `BinaryTreeMap`, but with a major difference:
each node contains two elements (`first` and `second`), instead of just one, and three children
(`left`, `middle` and `right`).
Their ordering relation should be `left < first < middle < second < right`.

Write a test class called `TernaryTreeMapTest` that extends `MyMapTestTemplate`.
If your implementation of `TernaryTreeMap` is correct, then all tests should pass.
Similarly to `BinaryTreeMapTest`,
add these further new tests:
* Add 2 distinct elements in a way that the tree depth is only 1 (ie, best case for 2 insertions).
* Add 3 distinct elements in a way that the tree depth is 3 (ie, worst case for 3 insertions).
* Add 8 distinct elements in a way that the tree depth is only 2 (ie, best case for 8 insertions).
