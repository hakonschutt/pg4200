# Exercise 10

"Inspired" by the code of `OnePlusOneEAForKnapsack` and `HillClimbingForQueens`,
write a (1+1)EA implementation `OnePlusOneEAForQueens` for the Queens problem.
Make particular attention on how to implement the mutation operator, as you 
cannot use a simple bit flip.

Write a test suite `OnePlusOneEAForQueensTest` similarly to what done in 
`QueensProblemTest` for the HC algorithm, i.e., write tests for boards of 
followings sizes: 8, 16, 20 and 100.
If your implementation of (1+1)EA is correct, those board sizes should be very quick
to solve.
